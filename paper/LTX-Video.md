# Background and Motivation
Video generation is a significant research direction in artificial intelligence, but existing video generation models often face challenges such as slow speed, low quality, or high computational resource requirements. Current text-to-video models like Sora, MovieGen, and CogVideoX have demonstrated the effectiveness of spatiotemporal transformers with self-attention and global receptive fields, but they typically rely on conventional VAE designs that may not optimally balance spatial and temporal compression.

The primary motivation behind the LTX-Video project is to create a model capable of generating high-quality videos in real-time while maintaining low computational resource requirements. The project aims to address several key limitations of existing video generation models:
1. Temporal consistency issues: Many models struggle to maintain temporal coherence in videos
2. Low computational efficiency: Existing models often require substantial computational resources and time
3. Limited detail generation capabilities: Compressed latent spaces often restrict the representation of high-frequency details

# Novelty and Key Contributions

The main innovations of LTX-Video include:

1. **Holistic Latent Diffusion Approach**: Seamlessly integrates the Video-VAE and denoising transformer, optimizing their interaction within a compressed latent space and sharing the denoising objective between the transformer and the VAE decoder.

2. **High-Compression Video-VAE with Novel Loss Functions**: By relocating the patchifying operation to the VAE and introducing novel loss functions, achieves a 1:192 compression ratio with spatiotemporal downsampling of 32×32×8, enabling the generation of high-quality videos at unprecedented speed.

3. **Innovative Architecture Design**:
   - Reconstruction GAN (rGAN): Improves the traditional GAN training framework by having the discriminator see both original and reconstructed samples, simplifying the discriminator's task
   - Multi-layer Noise Injection: Injects noise at several layers of the VAE decoder, allowing for more diverse high-frequency details
   - Uniform Log-Variance: Uses a single predicted log-variance shared across all latent channels, distributing the effect of the KL loss uniformly
   - Video DWT Loss: Introduces spatiotemporal Discrete Wavelet Transform loss to improve high-frequency detail reconstruction

4. **Faster Generation Speed**: LTX-Video is the fastest video generation model of its kind, capable of generating 121 frames at 768×512 pixels in just 2 seconds (using 20 diffusion steps on an NVIDIA H100 GPU), faster than the time it takes to watch the video.

5. **Versatile Applications**: Supports text-to-video and image-to-video generation, with the model able to be conditioned on any part of the input video through a simple timestep-based conditioning mechanism without requiring additional parameters or special tokens.

# Methodology and Realization Details

LTX-Video employs the following key technologies and methods:

1. **Video-VAE Architecture**:
   - Spatiotemporal compression of 32×32×8 with 128 channels, resulting in a total compression ratio of 1:192
   - Relocates the patchifying operation from the transformer's input to the VAE encoder for more efficient processing
   - VAE decoder performs both the final denoising step and latent-to-pixel conversion

2. **Video Transformer Architecture**:
   - Based on the Pixart-α architecture but with several enhancements
   - Uses Rotary Positional Embeddings (RoPE) instead of traditional absolute positional embeddings
   - Applies normalization to queries and keys before dot product attention computation to avoid extremely large values in attention logits

3. **Training Strategy**:
   - Employs Rectified-Flow training
   - Samples diffusion timesteps from a log-normal distribution
   - Multi-resolution training, enabling the model to generate videos of various resolutions and durations
   - Simultaneous training on images and videos

4. **Data Preparation**:
   - Uses an aesthetic model to evaluate and filter videos and images
   - Removes videos with insignificant motion and crops out black bars to standardize aspect ratios
   - Enhances metadata using an internal automatic image and video captioner to re-caption the entire training set

5. **Inference Process**:
   - Text-to-video generation: Directly generates videos from text prompts
   - Image-to-video generation: Uses the first frame as a condition to generate videos
   - Video extension: Generates longer videos conditioned on existing video segments
   - Multi-condition video generation: Generates videos based on a set of images and/or short video segments
